Sure, I can help with that! Here's a basic example of how you can use Python to get the output from Google AI Studio:
import requests

# Replace with your Google AI Studio API endpoint
api_endpoint = "https://your-google-ai-studio-endpoint"

# Replace with your API key
api_key = "your_api_key"

# Define the input data for the AI model
input_data = {
    "input": "your_input_data"
}

# Set up the headers with your API key
headers = {
    "Authorization": f"Bearer {api_key}",
    "Content-Type": "application/json"
}

# Make a POST request to the API endpoint
response = requests.post(api_endpoint, json=input_data, headers=headers)

# Check if the request was successful
if response.status_code == 200:
    # Get the output from the response
    output = response.json()
    print("Output:", output)
else:
    print("Error:", response.status_code, response.text)
Make sure to replace "https://your-google-ai-studio-endpoint" with the actual endpoint of your Google AI Studio model and "your_api_key" with your actual API key. The input_data should be structured according to the requirements of your specific AI model.
