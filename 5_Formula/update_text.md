Yes, you can change the text on a label in OBS programmatically using the OBS WebSocket API. Here’s how you can do it:

1. **Ensure OBS WebSocket Plugin is Installed and Enabled**:
   - Follow the steps mentioned earlier to install and enable the OBS WebSocket plugin.

2. **Use a Script to Change the Text**:
   - You can use a similar approach with Python to change the text of a label. Here’s an example script:

```python
import obswebsocket
import obswebsocket.requests

# Connect to OBS WebSocket server
client = obswebsocket.obsws("localhost", 4444, "your_password")
client.connect()

# Change the text of a label
source_name = "YourTextSourceName"
new_text = "Your new text here"
client.call(obswebsocket.requests.SetSourceSettings(source_name, {"text": new_text}))

# Disconnect from OBS WebSocket server
client.disconnect()
```

3. **Run the Script**:
   - Ensure you have the `obs-websocket-py` library installed (`pip install obs-websocket-py`).
   - Run the script to change the text on the label.

This script connects to the OBS WebSocket server, changes the text of the specified text source, and then disconnects. Make sure to replace `"YourTextSourceName"` with the name of your text source in OBS and `"Your new text here"` with the new text you want to display.
