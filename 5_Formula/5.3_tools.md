There are several tools available on Windows that can record microphone input and convert it to text. Here are a few options:

1. **Windows Dictation Tool**:
   - Built into Windows 10 and later, you can activate it by pressing **Windows logo key + H**. It allows you to dictate text directly into any text field, which you can then save manually[1](https://gotranscript.com/public/step-by-step-guide-to-converting-audio-to-text-using-windows-10-tools).

2. **Microsoft Word Transcribe**:
   - If you have a Microsoft 365 subscription, you can use the transcribe feature in Word. It allows you to record directly or upload an audio file, and it will transcribe the speech into text. You can then save the transcript as a Word document[2](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/office/transcribe-your-recordings-7fc2efec-245e-45f0-b053-2a97531ecf57).

3. **Google Live Transcribe**:
   - Although primarily an Android app, you can use it on a Windows PC through an Android emulator like BlueStacks. It provides real-time transcription and allows you to save the text[2](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/office/transcribe-your-recordings-7fc2efec-245e-45f0-b053-2a97531ecf57).

4. **Otter.ai**:
   - A popular web-based service that offers real-time transcription. You can use it through a web browser on Windows and save the transcriptions to text files[2](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/office/transcribe-your-recordings-7fc2efec-245e-45f0-b053-2a97531ecf57).

5. **Dragon NaturallySpeaking**:
   - A powerful speech recognition software that provides accurate transcription and allows you to save the text directly to files[2](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/office/transcribe-your-recordings-7fc2efec-245e-45f0-b053-2a97531ecf57).
