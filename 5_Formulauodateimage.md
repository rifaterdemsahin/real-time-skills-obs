To change the background image in OBS programmatically, you can use the OBS WebSocket plugin, which allows you to control OBS via a WebSocket API. Here’s a step-by-step guide:

1. **Install OBS WebSocket Plugin**:
   - Download and install the OBS WebSocket plugin from the OBS Project website.

2. **Enable WebSocket Server**:
   - Open OBS Studio.
   - Go to `Tools` > `WebSocket Server Settings`.
   - Enable the WebSocket server and set a password.

3. **Use a Script to Change the Background**:
   - You can use a scripting language like Python to interact with the OBS WebSocket API. Here’s an example script:

```python
import obswebsocket
import obswebsocket.requests

# Connect to OBS WebSocket server
client = obswebsocket.obsws("localhost", 4444, "your_password")
client.connect()

# Change the background image
source_name = "YourImageSourceName"
new_image_path = "path/to/your/new/background/image.png"
client.call(obswebsocket.requests.SetSourceSettings(source_name, {"file": new_image_path}))

# Disconnect from OBS WebSocket server
client.disconnect()
```

4. **Run the Script**:
   - Make sure you have the `obs-websocket-py` library installed (`pip install obs-websocket-py`).
   - Run the script to change the background image.

This script connects to the OBS WebSocket server, changes the file path of the specified image source, and then disconnects. Make sure to replace `"YourImageSourceName"` with the name of your image source in OBS and `"path/to/your/new/background/image.png"` with the path to your new background image.
